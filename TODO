- Create var with group of rules for each chain and include them all where referenced to handle all -j targets

- Include ip r / ip a information to augment information about the interfaces and networks. This way also indirect paths can be discovered via combinations of INPUT, FORWARD, OUTPUT chains via routing of the host.

- Use tokenizer or something alike to improve expressin parsing for improved expressiveness; to enable something like "(src_port == 123 and dst_port == 8080) or (src_port == 432 and dst_port == 80)".

- Include some heuristics to improve produced example.
  E.g.
  - try to set state to NEW if none is defined (and protocol is tcp or udp)
  - don't use the first and last IPs of a network, like 192.168.0.0

- Exclude output interface from INPUT rules and check for other chain specific setups.
